Now, I'm in my 3rd year in college, so I've started taking my education courses :) I'm pretty happy with my choice in career, even though the program at my school annoys me so often.</p>",

I've also seen a few \"digital gardens\" online, collections of things that the creator appreciates. I love the idea, and the digital garden sites made by others inspire me so much that I made my own.</p><p>It's organized like an apartment. A pretty strange apartment, since I'm not an artist and I wanted the elements to line up nicely to organize with a <code>grid</code>.</p>",
